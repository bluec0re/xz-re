Files and documentation of the XZ backdoor research

Published as part of my [Area 41 presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1svZTSUcUDxRfTaMfaFmozBNFUvIvWa_1ApUY5yB4BAc/preview).

Will be updated over time.

## Import files into Ghidra

To work with the Ghidra data, just import the liblzma.so.5.6.1.gzf and backdoor_types.gdt files into your project.
